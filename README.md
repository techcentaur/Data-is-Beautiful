# Data-is-Beautiful
A brief guide to learn data-visualisation, by using how the different methods, and libraries work altogether.

> This guide uses `jupyter notebooks`.

## Using Pandas
- [Manipulating Data](https://github.com/techcentaur/Data-is-Beautiful/blob/master/Pandas/manipulating-data.py.ipynb)
	- Reading, selecting, and filtering data.
- [Plotting with Pandas](https://github.com/techcentaur/Data-is-Beautiful/blob/master/Pandas/Plotting%20with%20pandas.ipynb)
	- Plotting univariate, bivariate, and multivariate graphs using pandas APIs.

## Using Seaborn
- [Plotting with Seaborn](https://github.com/techcentaur/Data-is-Beautiful/blob/master/Seaborn/Plotting%20with%20Seaborn.ipynb)
	- Plotting univariate and bivariate graphs.
- [Faceting with Seaborn](https://github.com/techcentaur/Data-is-Beautiful/blob/master/Seaborn/Faceting%20with%20Seaborn.ipynb)
	- Faceting and pairplots in seaborn

## Using Matplotlib
- [Subplotting](https://github.com/techcentaur/Data-is-Beautiful/blob/master/Matplotlib/Subplotting%20with%20Matplotlib.ipynb)
	- Forming subplots in matplotlib

## Using Plotnine
- [Grammar of Graphics](https://github.com/techcentaur/Data-is-Beautiful/blob/master/Plotnine/Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20with%20Plotnine.ipynb)
	- Learing plotting in plotnine with grammar.


### Note to Reader

Whilst writing jupyter notebooks, I faced several warning statuses during my calls in matplotlib, numpy, and pandas. I tried to suppress it with the function from `warnings` library as `warnings.filterwarnings("always")`; sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't.

These warnings are for developers, and can be safely ignored.
